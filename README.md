# Show-Hide-Password
A simple show and hide password feature implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The purpose of this feature is to provide users with the option to toggle between showing and hiding the password they have entered in a password field. This can help prevent typos and improve the user experience, as users can double-check their password entries before submitting them.
